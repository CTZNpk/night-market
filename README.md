# Night Market App

## Overview
The Night Market app is a simple Flutter application that uses an unofficial Valorant API to retrieve and display user-specific Night Market and Store data. The app allows users to manage multiple accounts, automatically check the Night Market for all added accounts, and search for specific items across all accounts.

**Note:** The Valorant API has undergone changes, and as a result, this project is no longer functional with the current API.

- **Automatic Market Check**: Automatically fetch and update Night Market and Store data for all linked accounts.
- **Item Search**: Search across all accounts to check if a specific item is available in any Night Market or Store.
